ðŸ“„ HelperConfig.sol

ðŸ§  PURPOSE:
    This contract helps us dynamically select or deploy the correct price feed address 
    depending on the network we're currently working on (Sepolia, Mainnet, or Anvil local chain).
    
    It makes our codebase chain-agnostic and easily testable on local and live environments.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

ðŸ§© HOW IT WORKS:

1. The contract defines a `NetworkConfig` struct to group config-related parameters 
   (currently just `PriceFeeds`, but scalable for more like VRFCoordinator, etc).

2. On contract deployment (via constructor), it checks the current `block.chainid` to 
   determine which network we're working on:

    - If it's Sepolia (`chainid == 11155111`) â†’ uses a hardcoded known PriceFeed address.
    - If it's Ethereum Mainnet (`chainid == 1`) â†’ uses the real Mainnet PriceFeed address.
    - If it's local (Anvil/Hardhat with `chainid == 31337`) â†’ deploys a mock price feed on-the-fly.

3. For Anvil (local testing):
   - First checks if a mock price feed has already been deployed by checking if `activeNetworkConfig.PriceFeeds` is non-zero.
   - If yes â†’ returns the already deployed mock config.
   - If not â†’ uses `vm.startBroadcast()` and `vm.stopBroadcast()` to deploy a `MockV3Aggregator` mock price feed.
   - Constants `DECIMALS` and `INITIAL_PRICE` are used to configure the mock.
   - The new mock address is returned and stored.

4. The chosen config is stored in the public variable `activeNetworkConfig`, 
   so that other scripts or contracts can easily access the right price feed address.

âœ… WHY THIS STRUCTURE IS USEFUL:

- Abstracts network-specific logic in one place.
- Cleanly separates config for each network.
- Easy to scale â€” just add more fields to the struct and update the 3 helper functions.
- Ensures mock deployment is automatic in local testing environments.
- Maintains compatibility with Foundry scripting tools using `vm`.

ðŸ”§ Depends On:
- `MockV3Aggregator.sol` (used to create mock price feed)
- `forge-std/Script.sol` (for `vm` scripting utilities)

## ðŸš€ Why `new HelperConfig()` is used in `DeployFundMe`

In the `DeployFundMe` script, we use:

```solidity
HelperConfig helperConfig = new HelperConfig();
(address getEthToUsdPriceFeed) = helperConfig.activeNetworkConfig();
```

Even though we import the `HelperConfig` contract, we still deploy it using `new`. Here's why:

### ðŸ§  What's Happening?

When we do `new HelperConfig()`, the constructor of `HelperConfig` runs.

That constructor checks `block.chainid` to detect the current network.

Based on the network:

- For local: deploys a mock price feed.
- For testnet/mainnet: uses a known address.

This returns the correct config inside `activeNetworkConfig`.

---

### ðŸ§± Why Not Just Import Without Deploying?

Smart contracts are not like regular classes or libraries â€” to access any state-changing logic or stored state, we need a live deployed instance on-chain.

We can't access `activeNetworkConfig` unless we instantiate the contract because:

- The variable is set during the constructor.
- The config is stored in that instance's storage.

---

### ðŸ§¬ Could We Use Inheritance?

Yes, we could inherit from `HelperConfig` like this:

```solidity
contract DeployFundMe is Script, HelperConfig {
    function run() external returns (FundMe) {
        address priceFeed = activeNetworkConfig.priceFeed;
        ...
    }
}
```

However:

| Pros                                   | Cons                                                   |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| No need to manually deploy `HelperConfig` | Tightly couples config logic into your deployment script |
| Shorter code                          | Less modular and harder to reuse in other scripts     |
| Convenient access                     | Harder to scale across multiple chains/deployers      |

âœ… In most real-world projects, we prefer **modularization over inheritance** â€” especially when multiple scripts may need access to `HelperConfig`.
